# AutonomousPathPlanner
Python script to generate path profiles.
Our path planner for autonomous programs allows the user to upload a picture of the field and add points to generate a planned path for the robot. You can change each pointâ€™s x and y values, velocity, and orientation. We apply a linear interpolation of the points and then smooth out the curves.
